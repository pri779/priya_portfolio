    <h3>CodeChef C Programming Test - 82% Score</h3>
    <p class="accomplishment-text">
        Achieving an 82% score in the CodeChef C Programming Test reflects my strong grasp of key concepts in C programming and my ability to apply them to solve complex problems efficiently. The test consisted of a series of challenging problems that tested my proficiency in various aspects of C, including control structures, functions, arrays, and pointers.
        <br><br>
        The questions required a deep understanding of algorithms and data structures, focusing on problem-solving skills, logic building, and optimizing solutions under time constraints. I worked on multiple types of challenges, ranging from basic syntax and logic to more advanced topics like recursion, sorting algorithms, and dynamic memory allocation.
